The [Dreams Society][0] is a charity serving Bahrain with the mission of bringing joy to children affected by terminal illness or by a debilitating disease by making their  dreams come true. 

Such illnesses include cancer, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.

Making a dream come true for a terminally or seriously ill child will not just brighten their life, it will be a gift that their parents and family will treasure forever. 

Today, I was lucky to be able to help fulfill the dream of one of these children.

Ali, a 12 year old boy,  had been diagnosed with Leukemia, and had received a long course of treatment including a bone marrow transplant in Singapore.

His illness has introduced him to the world of medicine from a young age, with daily tests and long hospital stays. 

When he was asked what his life dream would be, he said that he would like to be a doctor, to help other people the way his doctors helped him. Not just any Doctor, he wants to transplant bone marrows.

So, in a small step to guide him in the right direction, we brought Ali to our Hospital today, to make him a doctor for the day. We gave him a small tour of the hospital, as his condition was still fragile as he is still immunocompromised and easily susceptible to infections.

I think the thing he enjoyed most was riding in the ambulance. I'm a grown practicing doctor, and even I get a small thrill every time I get in an ambulance.

We were also able to give him a tour of the laboratory and show him some bone marrow slides under the microscope, which even his parents found fascinating as well.

All I can hope is that is we helped to make his life happier and hopefully inspired him to pursue his dream of being a doctor. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5b6edf8d-77b0-44a0-9bcd-b1ca69390c82.jpg)
